{"name":"Aristaeus","tagline":"","body":"### GROUP OBJECTIVES.\r\nThe target of this group is to provide the European authorities with the information and roadmaps to set up a complete set of R&D projects that lead to a first fractionated satellite demonstration flight not Later than year 2022. In order to achieve this target, this group proposes to setup a work plan that\r\nincludes various documents and milestones presented in this section.\r\n\r\nAs in previous developments, this group intends to follow a well known approach starting with low TRL activities co-funded by the different administration, advancing then to higher TRL developments led firstly by EC and then by ESA and other actors, ending in a first demonstration flight funded at European level and supervised by ESA from the technical point of view. This means that the group activities should evolve very quickly in the official setup of a European workgroup recognized as a legitimate agent at EC and ESA level. This group will propose some KETs that should be covered by EC projects included in the first half of the H2020 program. \r\nThen in the second half of the H2020 program, a SRA should be defined covering the most promising technologies developed in the first stage. This SRA should lead then to the kick off of a demonstration mission that would then follow the typical planning of a technology demonstration mission starting by a Phase A where the target application and the detailed feasibility studies should be accomplished with ESA support.\r\n\r\n### MEMBERS\r\nThe ARISTAEUS Group is fostered by Thales Alenia Space España from the industrial side and by Universidad Politécnica de Catalunya on the Academic area. The target of this group is to include all the actors in present FS studies as well as those space actors that will be involved in the first stages of in orbit demonstration and actual business exploitation of this new technology. Although clearly focused on the European space ecosystem, the group is also open both to actors outside Europe and outside to the present space business environment, being the main selection criteria those related to technical relevance and exploitation capability of the partners. Present partners include:\r\n* Delft University of Technology\r\n* University of Surrey\r\n* EADS-CASA\r\n* GMV\r\n* INTA\r\n\r\n\r\n### WHAT IS A FRACTIONATED SATELLITE?\r\nThe concept of fractionated satellite was devised by DARPA with the following target: “to develop and demonstrate the basic building blocks of a radically new space architecture in which traditional large, multi-functional “monolithic” spacecraft are replaced by clusters of wirelessly interconnected spacecraft elements. Each of these elements performs a subset of the tasks performed by a large classical spacecraft and works together in a cluster to provide the same overall effective mission\r\ncapability. Traditionally, taking as example the telecommunications market, space assets are developed as monolithic and large spacecraft. Each of these spacecraft unites all functionalities required to perform its mission. As a consequence, risk of launch failures and in-orbit operations failures would\r\nhave a high impact on the availability of service. Moreover, due to its monolithic nature, technologies applied can be mature but outdated, causing a lack of flexibility and eventually an inefficient implementation of a system to satisfy the customer needs. Fractionated satellite technologies, on the contrary, by allowing the various functions of a spacecraft to be developed and launched separately, provide benefits such as reduced overall risk, budgetary and planning flexibility, faster initial deployment, and ultimately greater survivability, including selective replacement of damaged or\r\nobsolete elements of a complex spacecraft”.\r\n\r\n![Fractionated Spacecraft ](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/FractionatedSpacecraft1.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
