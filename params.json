{"name":"Aristaeus","tagline":"","body":"### GROUP OBJECTIVES.\r\nThe target of this group is to provide the European authorities with the information and roadmaps to set up a complete set of R&D projects that lead to a first fractionated satellite demonstration flight not Later than year 2022. In order to achieve this target, this group proposes to setup a work plan that\r\nincludes various documents and milestones presented in this section.\r\n\r\nAs in previous developments, this group intends to follow a well known approach starting with low TRL activities co-funded by the different administration, advancing then to higher TRL developments led firstly by EC and then by ESA and other actors, ending in a first demonstration flight funded at European level and supervised by ESA from the technical point of view. This means that the group activities should evolve very quickly in the official setup of a European workgroup recognized as a legitimate agent at EC and ESA level. This group will propose some KETs that should be covered by EC projects included in the first half of the H2020 program. \r\nThen in the second half of the H2020 program, a SRA should be defined covering the most promising technologies developed in the first stage. This SRA should lead then to the kick off of a demonstration mission that would then follow the typical planning of a technology demonstration mission starting by a Phase A where the target application and the detailed feasibility studies should be accomplished with ESA support.\r\n\r\n### MEMBERS\r\nThe ARISTAEUS Group is fostered by Thales Alenia Space España from the industrial side and by Universidad Politécnica de Catalunya on the Academic area. The target of this group is to include all the actors in present FS studies as well as those space actors that will be involved in the first stages of in orbit demonstration and actual business exploitation of this new technology. Although clearly focused on the European space ecosystem, the group is also open both to actors outside Europe and outside to the present space business environment, being the main selection criteria those related to technical relevance and exploitation capability of the partners. Present partners include:\r\n* Delft University of Technology\r\n* University of Surrey\r\n* EADS-CASA\r\n* GMV\r\n* INTA\r\n\r\n\r\n### WHAT IS A FRACTIONATED SATELLITE?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually.
